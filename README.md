venting are a list of tools to help anyone take care of themselves.

## <img src="docs/imgs/forNoOne.ico" alt="Icon" height="25px" > For No One

This is a private way of expressing yourself: a chat in which you can write **whatever** you like.

The cool thing is: **no one is going to read it**, but yourself.

You can even change your No One's name and profile picture!

## <img src="docs/imgs/daysWithoutAlcohol.ico" alt="Icon" height="25px" > Days Without Alcohol

Pretty straight forward. A GitHub-like calendar in which, every day, you can mark it as another day that you didn't have any alcohol!

**I drank alcohol**, on the other hand, will mark the current day as a non-sober day.
